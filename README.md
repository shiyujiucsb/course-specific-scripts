# course-specific-scripts

Help your future TAs!
Please add the scripts specific to the course you are TAing that you may have created here.

A couple of notes on adding scripts:

1. Please make sure they are readable and their purpose is clearly stated.
2. Do NOT add any script that reveals some assignment specific detail.

If you have anything that you would like to be added to the repository, feel free to 
[fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)  and then submit 
a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).


Simply create a folder for your course and add scripts to it. If you want a private
repository for your course, let me know.
